/*

Whenever we do an operation(addition,substraction etc) based on the input 
we can actually CONVERT the input for the operation

CONVERT - we can convert type of input

There are two types of conversion -

Typecasting can be referred to as type conversion

Explicit Typecasting : This conversion can be manually done by us

Inplicity Typecasting/Internally or Automatically(Coercion) : The Language based on some certain rules automatically converts the types

All the Point under 7.1 https://262.ecma-international.org/#sec-abstract-operations like ToPrimitive,ToBoolean  all are abstract operations
